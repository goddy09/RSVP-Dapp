# RSVP dApp

This workshop will focus on creating a decentralized application for running [RSVP] events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSVP).

Ensure you have gone through the [Rock Paper Scissors](https://docs.reach.sh/tut/rps/#tut) tutorial before attempting this.

Create a directory named RSVP `~/reach/RSVP` where you would work in your [reach](https://docs.reach.sh/quickstart/#quickstart) folder.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/reach/RSVP && cd ~/reach/RSVP
```

Confirm you have Reach installed in `~/reach`:

```bash
$ ../reach version
```

Initialize the Reach program by running:

```bash
$ ../reach init
```

## **Problem Analysis**

Any program design process begins with a problem analysis to identify the information that is pertinent to the issue at hand.

In our case, we have the following questions:


> * Who is involved in this application?
> * What information do they know at the start of the program?
> * What information are they going to discover and use in the program?
> * What funds change ownership during the application and how?


You should write your answers in your Reach program (`index.rsh`) using a comment. /_ Remember comments are written like this. _/

**Write down the problem analysis of this program as a comment.**

Compare _your answers_ to _mine_:
